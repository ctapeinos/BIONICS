Title: Design of a biomimetic and neuroprotective nanocpsule for the treatment of post-ischemic stroke effects (BIONICS)

<p> Description <p> 
This MSCA project aims at overcoming the limitations of the current available strategies for the treatment of  post-ischemic stroke effects by introducing 'BIONICS', which represents a biomimetic and neuroprotective delivery nanocapsule.  Its novelty lies to the enhanced delivery of various reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) scavengers across the blood brain barrier (BBB), and the amelioration of the post-ischemic stroke symptoms through hypoxia and oxidative stress regulation.
